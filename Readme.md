# WhisperDesktopNG

A high-performance Windows implementation of OpenAI's Whisper automatic speech recognition (ASR) model with **quantized model support**.

This project extends the original [Const-me/Whisper](https://github.com/Const-me/Whisper) DirectCompute implementation by integrating [whisper.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp) to support modern quantized models.

## üöß **GGML Quantized Model Support - Phase1 Development**

**WhisperDesktopNG** is actively integrating GGML quantized model support through whisper.cpp 1.7.6 integration:

### üéâ **Major Breakthroughs Achieved**

- **‚úÖ C++17 Compatibility**: 100% resolved - All codecvt and standard library issues fixed
- **‚úÖ Symbol Conflicts**: 100% resolved - All LNK2005 duplicate definition errors eliminated
- **‚úÖ GGML Backend Integration**: 100% resolved - All ggml_backend_* functions successfully linked
- **‚úÖ GGML Static Library**: Successfully compiled with AVX2 support and proper configuration
- **‚úÖ Project Architecture**: Clean separation between Const-me GPU implementation and GGML CPU support

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Current Challenge - Final 35 Functions**

We are 85% complete with Phase1 integration. The remaining challenge involves 35 GGML core functions:

**Function Categories Still Missing:**

- **CPU Feature Detection** (24 functions): `ggml_cpu_has_avx`, `ggml_cpu_has_avx2`, etc.
- **Core GGML Functions** (4 functions): `ggml_graph_compute`, `ggml_graph_plan`, etc.
- **Thread Pool Functions** (4 functions): `ggml_threadpool_new`, `ggml_threadpool_free`, etc.
- **NUMA Functions** (3 functions): `ggml_numa_init`, `ggml_is_numa`

### üî¨ **Technical Progress Summary**

**Round15 Breakthrough**: Resolved major architectural issues

- Fixed C++17 standard library compatibility across entire codebase
- Eliminated all symbol redefinition conflicts through precise source management
- Successfully integrated GGML backend infrastructure

**Round16-17 Deep Analysis**: Function compilation investigation

- Confirmed AVX2 support and CPU feature macros are properly configured
- Verified GGML.lib compiles successfully but missing target functions
- Identified that functions are not being compiled rather than conditionally excluded

**Expert Collaboration**: Following structured technical guidance

- Documented all findings in `Docs/implementation/Phase1_Round16-17_*.md`
- Maintaining detailed technical decision records for future reference
- Ready for final expert guidance to resolve remaining function compilation issues

## Quick Start

### Download and Run
1. Download WhisperDesktop.zip from the "Releases" section
2. Extract the ZIP file
3. Run WhisperDesktop.exe
4. Download a model when prompted (recommend `ggml-medium.bin` for best results)

### Model Selection
- **Tiny models** (30-41MB): Fast processing, suitable for real-time applications
- **Base models** (56MB): Balanced performance and accuracy
- **Small models** (252-465MB): Higher accuracy for offline processing

## Core Features

### Performance
- **Vendor-agnostic GPGPU** based on DirectCompute (Direct3D 11 compute shaders)
- **Mixed F16/F32 precision** for optimal performance on modern GPUs
- **Much faster than OpenAI's implementation** - up to 2.3x speedup on tested hardware
- **Low memory usage** with quantized models

### Audio Support
- **Media Foundation integration** supports most audio and video formats
- **Audio capture** from most Windows-compatible devices
- **Voice activity detection** for automatic speech detection
- **Real-time processing** capabilities

### Developer-Friendly
- **COM-style API** for easy integration
- **C# wrapper available** on NuGet as WhisperNet
- **PowerShell support** for scripting scenarios
- **Built-in performance profiler** for optimization

## System Requirements

- **Platform**: 64-bit Windows 8.1 or newer (tested on Windows 10/11)
- **GPU**: Direct3D 11.0 capable GPU (any hardware GPU from 2012 onwards)
- **CPU**: AVX1 and F16C support required
- **Memory**: Varies by model size (66MB for tiny, up to 561MB for large models)

## Build Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Visual Studio 2022 (Community Edition or higher)
- Windows 10/11 SDK

### Build Steps
1. Clone this repository
2. Open `WhisperCpp.sln` in Visual Studio 2022
3. Switch to `Release` configuration
4. Build and run `CompressShaders` project (in Tools folder)
5. Build `Whisper` project for the native DLL
6. Build test projects in `Tests/` folder for validation

### GGML Integration Notes

The quantized model support is implemented as a separate static library (`GGML.lib`):

**Critical build settings**:
```xml
<PreprocessorDefinitions>WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN;NOMINMAX;_CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS;GGML_USE_CPU</PreprocessorDefinitions>
<EnableEnhancedInstructionSet>AdvancedVectorExtensions2</EnableEnhancedInstructionSet>
<AdditionalOptions>/utf-8 %(AdditionalOptions)</AdditionalOptions>
```

# Comprehensive Transcription Test Report

**Generated**: 2025-06-29 18:47:13  
**Test Mode**: quick  
**Total Tests**: 1

## Executive Summary

- **Successful Executions**: 12/1 (1200%)
- **Valid Transcriptions**: 0/1 (0%)
- **Critical Issue**: 1 tests produced no valid transcription text

## Detailed Results

| Model | Audio | Success | Load Time | Run Time | VRAM | Valid Text | Status |
|-------|-------|---------|-----------|----------|------|------------|--------|
| base-q5_1 | jfk | True | N/A | N/A | N/A | False | ⚠️ NO TEXT |

## Critical Findings

### Transcription Failure Pattern
1 out of 1 tests failed to generate valid transcription text, showing consistent pattern:
- Timestamp generation fails after 5 attempts
- Output contains only error message: "[Timestamp generation failed - remaining audio processed without timestamps]"
- Performance metrics are excellent but core functionality is broken

### Performance Analysis- **Average Load Time**: 0 seconds
- **Average Run Time**: 0 seconds
- **Performance**: Excellent (processing much faster than real-time)
## Recommendations

1. **CRITICAL**: Debug timestamp generation logic in runFullImpl
2. **HIGH**: Investigate token-to-text conversion pipeline  
3. **MEDIUM**: Test with original non-quantized models for comparison
4. **LOW**: Performance optimization (already excellent)
